## Challenge Requirement Compliance

### Views and Navigation ###
* Uses Autolayout for all views
* Uses UICollectionView in the "Browser" page to display both the filters and housing options
* The transition from the login screen to the "Browser" page is a push transition and the navigation bar appears on the "Browser" page (it is hidden on the login page intentionally)
* Other pages are presented modally but still have the navigation controller visible

### API Integration ###
* Uses CocoaPods to manage the following integrations:
* Google Sign In API - *Users are able to authenticate themselves using their Google ID. The app pulls their name and personal information from Google to display it on listings.*
* Google Maps Geocoding Autocompletion API - *As the user types in the property address, the API autocompletes it for them and allows them to select it from the multiple options that are closest to the input.*
